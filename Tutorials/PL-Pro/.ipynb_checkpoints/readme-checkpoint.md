### QSAR of SARS-CoV Papain-Like Protease (PLPro)

Since the 2002/2003 SARS outbreak, several potential SARS-CoV1 drug targets have been identified. Many SARS-CoV essential functions, like replication, are carried out by the **non-structural proteins (nsps)**  encoded in open reading frame (ORF) 1a and 1b. ORF 1a and 1b encode two large viral polyproteins, **pp1a** and **pp1b**, which must be cleaved by proteases into the 16 viral nsps that they encode. These nsps include the viral replicase complex proteins, so are critical for the virus to function [**1**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214003660?via%3Dihub#f0005).

The processing of **pp1a** and **pp1b** are carried out by two virally encoded proteases, the papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro), aka the main protease (Mpro).

### MIT AI Cures Initiative

In this set of notebooks, we'll loosely follow the work by the [**MIT AI Cures Initiative**](https://www.aicures.mit.edu/data), a team of researchers gathering [data](https://www.aicures.mit.edu/data) on SARS-CoV 1 and 2 and use artificial intelligence to repurpose drugs as COVID-19 theraputics. The team includes the author of [**Chemprop**](https://github.com/yangkevin2/chemprop), a state of the art graph-convolution network used to discover promsing antibiotic candidates in [**A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30102-1).
