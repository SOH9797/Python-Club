### New to Python?
In this tutorial we'll get **python** and **jupyter notebook** set up on your machine so you can get coding!

## Anaconda (recommended method)
Anaconda is a python distribution and package manager aimed at scientists. It comes with loads of great features, including the jupyter notebook, an interactive python shell that opens in your browser and is perfect for data analysis!

* Download Anaconda from [**this page**](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) and get a python 3.7 + installer.
* Follow the instructions in the install wizard
* That's it. Now you can start a jupyter notebook by searching for it in your programs or by typing ```jupyter-notebook``` into your command line

## Python.org
* You can get a basic installation of python from the official [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) site.
* You can install **jupyter notebook** by running the ```pip intall jupyter``` command in your command prompt.
* Now you can start a jupyter notebook using ```jupyter-notebook``` in your command line.
